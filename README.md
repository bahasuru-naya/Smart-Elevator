In today's urban landscape, where high-rise buildings dominate skylines, efficient vertical transportation systems are indispensable. Smart Elevator is a cutting-edge project aimed at revolutionizing the way we perceive and utilize elevators within these towering structures. Combining state-of-the-art technology with innovative design, Smart Elevator is poised to redefine the standards of vertical transportation efficiency, safety, and convenience.

## My Role:
- Developed a remote elevator control application using the RemoteXY platform for seamless management of elevator operations from a mobile device.
- Engineered an advanced emergency button system integrated with a GSM module, enabling automatic SMS notifications to authorities when activated.
- Programmed elevator operational logic using Arduino technology to facilitate user-selected floor navigation, including ascending, descending, and stopping functionalities.
- Contributed to enhancing elevator usability, safety, and responsiveness as part of a comprehensive project aimed at improving vertical transportation systems.
